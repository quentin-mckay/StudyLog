- uploaded local lisascope.com to a subdomain of my hostgator account @ lisascope.quentinmckay.com
  - used All-in-One WP Migration
    - intial problem but fixed. Local by Flywheel is using PHP 7.1 but Hostgator was still using 5.x so looked up how to change that and it worked

# August 29
- fixed slider images not working on home page 
  - native Elementor "Slides" seems bugged
  - fix was using a 3rd party addon package

# August 30
- figured out how to create Pixiebay feature set inside lisascope.com (following recent WPTuts video)
  - almost gave up because the last step (accessing ACF gallery field from Single template) didn't seem to work
    but clicked on wrench icon at the last second and voila!
  - custom post type Location (using Custom Post Type UI plugin)
  - Advanced Custom Field Pro gallery field
- watched WPCrafter SEO plugins comparison video
