# Jan 19

- Traversy CSS Grid Responsive Website Mobile-First tutorial
  - a strange one b/c uses Grid in a way I haven't seen anywhere before (adding `display: grid` to each section via class `.grid`)
  - also uses Flex with some fixed widths (seemingly effective but not recommended in the CodeTech talk by Grid pioneer Rachel Andrews)
- getting comfortable with the workflow for project (code -> GitHub Desktop Client -> create branches + merge -> push to GitHub -> create GitHub Project Page)

# Jan 20 - 22

- solidifying my workflow of putting past project onto quentinmckay.com

# Jan 23

- watched video on mysql injections

# Feb 6 - Feb 14
- followed Advanced WebDevBootcamp Flexbox, Async Foundations, and Fetch sections
  - Fetch Random User example
- started Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide (Maximillian Schwarzmuller)

# Feb 17
- wrote Monster Slayer in Vue

# Feb 24
- switched to VS Code over the weekend
  - main benefits
    1. integrated terminal (the terminal plugin in Atom was always a little bit janky)
    2. integrated linting (still not entirely sure what Intellisense is)
    3. integrated debugger
    4. reason I switched to Atom in the first place is because I liked the "look" 
        but I just downloaded a really popular theme to make Code look like Atom
- continuing Vue: The Complete Guide
  - coded Wonderful Quotes (second project of the course)

# Feb 25 - March 3
- put Monster Slayer and Wonderful Quotes on website
- Vue course
  - Section 11: Forms and Inputs
  - Section 12: Custom Directives
  - Section 13: Filters and Mixins
  - Section 14: Animations and Transitions
  - built the Super Quiz (with the flip animation)

# March 4
- wanted to add flash-red-when-wrong animation to Super Quiz (rather than ugly alert() like Max does)
  - researched how to re-trigger a css animation
    - 1st solution is to remove the triggering class via `setTimeout()` then re-add to `element.classList` (problem is duration is coded in both CSS and javascript)
    - 2nd solution is Web Animation API. Very cool! (pretty new and not implemented in all browsers yet)
  - going to go implement it tonight

# March 12
- "finished" the Super Quiz (haven't made a quentinmckay.com entry yet)

- finished vue-router and vuex sections
  - vuex is confusing (not entirely sure what benefits it provides other than allowing access to all the data from any component. All the getters/mutations/actions seem like an unnecessary amount of boilerplate). hopefully this gets cleared up during the Final Project in the next section.

# March 14

  - frustrated by not being able to get initial fetch requests working
    - lack of understanding of what VSCode Live-Server extension is doing
    - partial solution was adding header option to fetch post and put request
    - final solution was to just move the Vue code into the same project folder as Express API
